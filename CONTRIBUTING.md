## Development

### Running locally

Clone this project, and open it in Nova.

Run `yarn` in a terminal to install dependencies.

Run the Development task to build scripts and auto-rebuild on file changes.

Turn on extension development in Nova in Preferences > General > Extension Development. If you've installed the TypeScript extension from the Extension Library, disable it, then activate the local one with Extensions > Activate Project as Extension.

**note** Running the watcher can cause a lot of restarts of the extension, which often causes Nova's extension service to crash. I'd recommend building manually instead. If the extension service crashes, deactivate the project as an extension and reactivate it.

### Debugging

To debug the underlying language server, modify the `run.sh` file to use the [`--inspect` flag](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/) and use [your preferred inspector to debug](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/#inspector-clients).

Use the Extension Console in Nova to debug the extension. I haven't found a way to get a debugger attached to the JavaScriptCore context.

### Extension dependencies

The extension relies on local copies of both `typescript-language-server` and `typescript` itself. To avoid a large bundled extension size (Panic has a limit, you'll get 500 errors when submitting above ~50mb) these are locked with a [`shrinkwrap file`](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-npm/shrinkwrap-json.html).

To update, install locally in the `typescript.novaextension` directory, then run `npm shrinkwrap`.

## Publishing notes

Always run `yarn build` first, so the `typescript.novaextension/node_modules` directory is cleared.
